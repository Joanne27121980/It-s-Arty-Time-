This project was the result of building on an existing freeCodeCamp project in the Full Stack Certification course. 
As much as I loved the original outcome (three markers, centralised, column-style), I felt compelled to add more. As a trained visual artist, I felt that three markers was a little stingy ðŸ˜† so I set about adding three coloured pencils.
This led to my considering some simple animations. Sliding pen lids and wiggly pencils using simple CSS and Javascript. Together with a confetti burst on refresh and colour-changing background.
